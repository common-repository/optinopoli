Use this Wordpress plugin to collect email addresses and generate leads from your blog. 

Add the following to your blog with ease:

* Popups - including exit popups, slide-in popups, time-delay popups, on-click popups and more
* Floating header and footer bars
* Full-screen Welcome Mats (Wordpress capture page)
* Wordpress email subscription widgets for your sidebar, within posts, at the end of posts, or anywhere else you choose.

Plus our powerful *Landing Mats* mean you can collect emails from across the web too—from wherever you publish content!

Get immediate access to over 60 instant-use high conversion optin templates—start capturing more emails just minutes from now. Create beautiful opt-in forms with our easy-to-use opt-in form builder, including 150+ background gradients and 150+ designer fonts.

Use this optin forms plugin to create slide-in popup boxes, scroll-triggered popups, time-delayed popups, on-exit popups and more. Plus add email subscription forms within posts, after posts, and in your sidebar.

You can even have link-triggered popups—so when a visitor clicks a link you provide, a popup opt-in form instantly appears to capture their email.

Unlike other Wordpress popup plugins, you don't have to waste time creating separate campaigns for mobile, and then try to keep them in sync. Ours are **fully responsive** as standard, automatically adjusting for different devices.

> **optinopoli™**
> The optinopoli™ app works on any kind of website, including those running on Wordpress. To use this plugin, you need to have a 100% free optinopoli™ account, with full support provided. [Click here to learn more about optinopoli™](https://www.optinopoli.com).

= Capture New Leads Quickly =

With other Wordpress popup plugins, you end up with multiple shortcodes across your site that are hard to keep track of. It makes it slow to add new campaigns, and difficult to adjust them later—and usually you'll need a web developer to help. 

In contrast, with optinopoli™, you create, start and manage campaigns directly from the dashboard within your [free account](https://www.optinopoli.com). It means you're in full control 24/7—launch new campaigns in seconds, stop and re-start them whenever you want, all without needing a web developer.

= Quick, Easy Integration with Autoresponder Services =

We provide quick and easy free integrations with top email marketing and autoresponder services including:

* MailChimp
* GetResponse
* Aweber
* Infusionsoft
* Constant Contact
* iContact
* ActiveCampaign
* Campaign Monitor
* Sendlane

Choose which list to add new subscribers too, which tags to add (where provided), and more.

We also provide POST notification webhooks for more advanced users and developers.

Optionally get a free email notification with each new subscriber, so you can see where they were captured from and know exactly how your email capture forms are performing.

= Super Fast =

Did you know that other Wordpress popup plugins make pages load slower? They often add code for every popup you've installed on your site, to each and every page—even when those popups will never show on the page the visitor's on!

In contrast, we understand that page load times are crucial for conversion rates, as well as for other things like SEO that help build subscribers by attracting more visitors.

So with this in mind, our optin popup code is optimized for speed:

* Scripts for popups are pulled in dynamically only as and when needed.
* Any such code is minified to ensure optimal performance and maximum conversions.

= Content Upgrades =

Content upgrades are a great way to grow your email list by offering a specific type of [Lead Magnet](https://www.optinopoli.com/leadmagnets) that's highly relevant to the page the visitor is on. 

For example, you might provide a free resource that adds more value to the information on the page, but the visitor has to enter their email to get it.

They can achieve high conversion rates, simply because what you're offering is so relevant to the visitor.

Here are some example results:

* Brian Dean implemented content upgrades on his Backlinko site to [boost his conversions by 785%](https://backlinko.com/increase-conversions) in the space of a single day.
* Two other blog owners used them to [increase their conversion rate by an average 529%](https://backlinko.com/conversion-optimization)

The good news is that this optinopoli™ plugin is the easiest way to add content upgrades to your own blog. For example:

* For a single content upgrade, you can quickly add multiple ways for visitors to your page to get the resource, such as a link-activated popup, a popup on-exit, and maybe a floating header or footer bar that appears when they've scrolled so far down the page. Achieve higher conversions, and *there's no need to use multiple different systems to get it set up—just use optinopoli™.*
* Manage the downloadable resources from within your [free optinopoli™ account](https://www.optinopoli.com) — optionally allow immediate download by new subscribers, and distribute them through our high-performance CDN, completely free.
